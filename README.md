RRFRSSFeed
=============

Welcome to RRF RSS Feed. 

I created this little chunk of code because:
==============================================
A) I needed it for a project
B) I wanted to share more code
C) I wanted to learn more about CocoaPods
D) I wanted to mess with blocks
E) There is no "E"

This code is based on the [RSS 2.0 specification.](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html) It may not be a 100% implementation, now, or ever. See point "A" above for my reasoning.

Please read this prior to pulling the code and building. 

You need to make sure you're setup to use CocoaPods.

### [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Creating-a-project-that-uses-CocoaPods "CocoaPods")

- If you don't have Cocoapods installed you can install with `gem install cocoapods`.
- After cloning the app for the first time on a machine run `pod install` in the root directory to install all linked pods.
- After pulling in new changes run `pod update` to make sure that everything is up to date.

### Open Source Projects
This application makes use of the following open source project(s).

- [TouchXML](https://github.com/TouchCode/TouchXML) - TouchXML is a lightweight replacement for Cocoa's NSXML
